Full Screen Responsive Loader with Progress Bar Animation

This project demonstrates how to create a full-screen, responsive animation using JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.

Steps:
1. Create an HTML file (index.html) and add the basic structure.
2. Link the CSS file (style.css) to the HTML file using the <link> tag.
3. Inside the HTML file, create a loader element (<div id="loader">) with two child elements:
   - A loading text element (<div id="loading-text">) to display the progress percentage.
   - A progress bar element (<div id="progress-bar">) to visualize the progress.
4. Create a JavaScript file (script.js) and link it to the HTML file using the <script> tag.
5. In the JavaScript file, add an event listener for the 'DOMContentLoaded' event.
6. Inside the event listener, define the animation duration and progress interval variables.
7. Get the loading text and progress bar elements using the document.getElementById() method.
8. Define an animate() function that increments the progress and updates the elements accordingly.
9. Start the animation by calling the animate() function.
10. Handle the animation completion by clearing the interval and performing any additional actions.
11. Save the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in the same directory.
12. Open the HTML file in a web browser to see the full-screen, responsive animation in action.

Note: Adjust the animation duration and styling properties (background color, font size, font family, etc.) as per your requirements.
