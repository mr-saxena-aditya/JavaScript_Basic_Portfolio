Text Typing Animation

This project demonstrates a typing animation that displays the words "Aditya Saxena" on the screen.

Instructions:
1. Open the index.html file in a web browser.
2. The animation will start automatically, typing out the words "Aditya Saxena" on the screen.
3. The animation is full screen and responsive.
4. The background color is black and the font color is white.
5. The font size is 70px.

Customization:
- To change the displayed text, modify the `text` variable in the script.js file.
- To adjust the typing speed, modify the delay in the `setTimeout` function in the script.js file.
- You can modify the CSS in the styles.css file to customize the appearance of the animation.

Note: Make sure all the files (index.html, styles.css, and script.js) are in the same directory when running the project.
